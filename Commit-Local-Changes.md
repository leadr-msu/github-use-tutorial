To commit local changes to your cloned repo, save the files in the text editor and then go to the GitHub application.

Make sure you have selected the correct repo on the left side of the window (you can see that I have several repos).

Then, select the "Changes" tab at the top.

Give the commit a summary name, and then click the "Commit to..." button at the bottom.

The changes have now been saved into your cloned repo locally, but they are not yet on your original repo online. If you have made a mistake and committed something you did not intend to commit, you can keep the changes from going to the original repo by not doing any of these further steps. If this happens, it would be best to contact me (Brian Geyer) so I can show you how to properly save the work you want to save and delete the work you didn't mean to do.
