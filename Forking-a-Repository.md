To fork a repository (repo), make sure you are logged into GitHub and then navigate your browser to the repo's main page on GitHub's website. I will be using the Spring 2016 iteration of [_This is Indian Country_](https://github.com/msu-anthropology/indian-country-ss16) to demonstrate this.

Click on the "Fork" button near the top-right of the page.

This should redirect you to a new page, which will be for your forked repo, even though it looks the same as the page from the original repo.

![forked repository name](https://github.com/msu-anthropology/daea-fs16/blob/master/wiki/repo-name.png)

Note how the name of this repo is your username, followed by the repo name, with the original repo's username and repo name combination underneath it.
