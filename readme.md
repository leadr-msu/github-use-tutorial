# GitHub Use Tutorial
Prepared by Brian Geyer

## Forking a Repository

To fork a repository (repo), make sure you are logged into GitHub and then navigate your browser to the repo's main page on GitHub's website. I will be using the Spring 2016 iteration of [This is Indian Country](https://github.com/msu-anthropology/indian-country-ss16) to demonstrate this. 

Click on the "Fork" button near the top-right of the page. This should redirect you to a new page, which will be for your forked repo, even though it looks the same as the page from the original repo. 

Note how the name of this repo is your username, followed by the repo name, with the original repo's username and repo name combination underneath it. 

## Cloning a Repository

Cloning is the process of saving a local copy of your repo to your own computer, so that you can make changes outside of the internet. A clone is simply a local version of a repo, which means it must be synced periodically with your version on the web. To do this, you must first download and install the [GitHub Desktop program](http://desktop.github.com) and make sure you have set up the program by logging into your account. 

### FOR PC
To confirm you have logged into your account, locate the settings area of the application. It is the button that looks like a gear. This will bring up a list of places to go to change various settings. Pick the one that says "Options..." [options](wp-content/uploads/2016/03/options.png) Here you find whether or not you are logged into your account. If you see your account, then great, if not, you'll see this view, with the option to "Add Account." Login to your account to complete the process. 

### FOR MAC 
To confirm you have logged into your account, click on "GitHub Desktop" in the Menu Bar at the top of the screen and choose "Preferences..." to open the Preferences window. Click on the "Accounts" tab, and confirm that you are signed into your account. If you are not, add your credentials and click "Sign In." 

To clone, go back to the repo on GitHub in your internet browser and click on the button that looks like a computer monitor with an arrow pointing down into it. This may open up a window that asks for permission to launch a program. Grant this permission. This will launch your GitHub desktop application and will ask you where you will like to save the repo. Iit is best to keep all your cloned repos in a single folder titled GitHub. 

After accepting the location, your clone is now on your computer. You will notice that the application shows the active branch at the top of the window. Please simply leave this setting alone and do not change between branches. This will make things easier for you for the duration of this project. 

If you do wish to understand how branch changes on a cloned repo work, please come and see a staff person in LEADR.

## Making Changes Locally

To make changes to your cloned repo before sending them to the original online, install a text editing program. LEADR recommends [Notepad++](https://notepad-plus-plus.org/download/) for PC or [TextWrangler](https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/textwrangler/id404010395?mt=12) for Mac. To open any single file (including the .html files we're editing for this project), simply right-click for PC, or control-click for Mac, on the file and choose the text editor from the list (at least, Notepad++ adds itself to this list), or choose "Open With" and then pick the text editor. If you want to view changes as you make them to .html files, simply double-click to open and it should open in your internet browser. As you make changes in the text editor to the file, you can refresh the window or tab of the file in the browser to see the changes immediately.

## Commit local changes

To commit local changes to your cloned repo, save the files in the text editor and then go to the GitHub application. Make sure you have selected the correct repo on the left side of the window. Then, select the "Changes" tab at the top. Give the commit a summary name, and then click the "Commit to..." button at the bottom.
